This small project contains examples of using dataformat-xml. The purpose of the examples is to show how to write one code to parse both XML and JSON documents.
It also contians tricky use case currently not supported by dataformat-xml, when raw XML value needs to be extracted. For more details please see the issue:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/417
